The circuit of this project is made up of 6 leds connected in parallel and
a switch and a battery connected in series (check the schematic).
Place the leds on the perfboard at such positions so the letter A is "human-readable". 

//BETTER IMPLEMENTATION

It would be better if I had connected a resistor(330Î©) in series with the battery so 
as to limit the current that passes through the leds.Doing so, you make sure that the leds
will not be burned.
